## Data Pipelines:
1. Real-Time Data Integration:
1. 
1. Approach: Implement real-time or near-real-time data pipelines to ingest and process streaming data from healthcare providers and systems.
1. Tools: Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis, or Azure Stream Analytics can capture and process real-time data events, enabling timely insights and actions.
1. Batch Processing:
1. 
1. Approach: Schedule batch jobs to process and analyze data in regular intervals (e.g., daily, hourly).
1. Tools: Apache Spark, Apache Airflow, or custom-built scripts can execute batch processing tasks to update data warehouses, generate reports, and perform data transformations.
1. Data Pipeline Orchestration:
1. 
1. Approach: Orchestrate and monitor complex data workflows to ensure reliability and scalability.
1. Tools: Apache Airflow, Luigi, or Kubernetes-based solutions can orchestrate data pipelines, manage dependencies, and handle job scheduling and execution.
